The report generates tables and figures needed for the technical report of potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma.

Observations and Insights
Based on the analysis here are a few bullet points of observations:

For all four treatments: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, the statistic means are close to medians and the SEMs are low, indicating the results are accurate and data sets are symmetrically distributed.
1. Comparing Capomulin to the other three most promising treatments( Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin), the statistics show that Capomulin treatment delivers similar result to Ramicane with slightly bigger average tumor volume indicating slight worse performance. However, significantly better than result from Infubinol and Ceftamin treatments. Final tumor volumes analysis shows similar result: Capomulin treatment results slightly bigger average final tumors comparing to Ramicane treatment, while significantly better than the other two treatments.
2. Under Capomulin treatment the tumor volumes for most mice shrink down after a period of time.  
3. There is a strong positive relationship between tumor volumes and mice weight with high coefficient and r value.
